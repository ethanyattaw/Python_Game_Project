    "You, embodied by a turtle, are navigating the streets of Binghamton on Halloween. You traverse the streets by moving the Turtle upwards on the map, where you will encounter various endeavors along the way. This includes a fight, a trivia puzzle, and another fight against a well-known friend (or perhaps foe?) As you complete these missions, you will collect candy for your achievements. If you survive the night and pass all the obstacles, you will win the game and see how much candy you have earned! After all, that is the goal on Halloween. I mean, BINGOWEEN.\"\"\"\n",
